    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>2 (24 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
        <p>Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. Remove and discard casings.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat.<br>Add sausages and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until sausage begins to brown, and onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
        <p>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.<br>Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off heat and reserve until needed. Before using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 4</li></strong>
        <p>While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions on the package call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a large mixing bowl.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 5</li></strong>
        <p>Carefully add the meat sauce and stir until thoroughly combined. Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 6</li></strong>
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large 9x15-inch or 9x13-inch casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 7</li></strong>
        <p>Use a slotted spoon to transfer half of the pasta and sauce mixture to the prepared dish, then use a spatula to even out into a uniform layer.<br>Top with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and then 1/2 of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese, being sure to distribute evenly.<br>Top with the rest of the pasta and sauce mixture and give the pan a little shake to settle the sauce. Repeat the cheese application.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 8</li></strong>
        <p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the casserole is piping hot, 30 to 35 minutes.<br>Remove from the oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Top with parsley.</p>
